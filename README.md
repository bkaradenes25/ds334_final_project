# Final Project
My final project is focused on MLB playoff statcast data from the past 5 years. Specifically, I am interested in batter's spray charts and the correlation between launch angle and velocity. With increased analytics in baseball over the past couple of decades, I think it's important to take a deep dive into some of the terms and statistics thrown around the game. Hopefully, this project will allow people to take a moment and understand how game trends have changed and see what kind of impact launch angle and exit velocity have on batted ball outcomes. Below are some example outputs from my shiny app.
